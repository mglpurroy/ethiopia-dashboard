# Streamlit Cloud Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The optimized dashboard was failing to deploy on Streamlit Cloud due to problematic dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

## Root Cause
The original optimized requirements.txt included performance packages that are incompatible with Streamlit Cloud's environment:
- `numba>=0.57.0,<0.59.0` - Requires LLVM compiler tools not available in Streamlit Cloud
- `cython>=0.29.0,<3.1.0` - C extension compilation issues
- `pympler>=0.9,<1.0` - Memory profiling package not essential for cloud deployment
- Strict version constraints (`<2.0.0`) that conflict with Streamlit Cloud's environment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Requirements.txt
Removed problematic packages and used more flexible version constraints:
```
# Before (Problematic)
streamlit>=1.28.0,<2.0.0
pandas>=2.0.0,<2.2.0
numba>=0.57.0,<0.59.0  # PROBLEMATIC
cython>=0.29.0,<3.1.0  # PROBLEMATIC
pympler>=0.9,<1.0      # PROBLEMATIC

# After (Streamlit Cloud Compatible)
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.5.0
psutil>=5.9.0  # Lightweight alternative
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Made file caching optional for environments without write permissions
- Added graceful fallbacks for missing cache directories
- Improved error messages for missing data files
- Silent failure handling for cloud environments

### 3. Streamlit Cloud Optimizations
- Disabled file caching when write permissions are unavailable
- Added compatibility checks for different Streamlit versions (`st.rerun()` vs `st.experimental_rerun()`)
- Better handling of Git LFS files (data files)

## Performance Impact
The core optimizations remain intact:
- ✅ Session state caching (works on Streamlit Cloud)
- ✅ Streamlit native caching with TTL
- ✅ Vectorized pandas operations
- ✅ Optimized data processing
- ✅ Canvas-based map rendering
- ✅ Performance monitoring dashboard

Only removed:
- ❌ File-based persistent caching (not essential, session caching sufficient)
- ❌ JIT compilation (numba) - marginal benefit for this use case
- ❌ Memory profiling tools (not needed in production)

## Deployment Status
✅ **Fixed**: Streamlit Cloud should now deploy successfully
✅ **Maintained**: All core performance optimizations preserved
✅ **Enhanced**: Better error handling and cloud compatibility

## Expected Behavior
- First load: Slightly slower as cache builds (still faster than original)
- Subsequent loads: Fast due to session state caching
- No file caching warnings in cloud environment
- Full functionality maintained
